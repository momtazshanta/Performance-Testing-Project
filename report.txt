Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server restful-booker.herokuapp.com. 

100 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 119 And Total Concurrent API requested: 300.
200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 294 And Total Concurrent API requested: 600.
400 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 700 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.
500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 255 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1500.

While executed 500 concurrent request, not found  request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.00%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 500 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
